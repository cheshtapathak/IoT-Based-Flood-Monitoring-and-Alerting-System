# IoT-Based-Flood-Monitoring-and-Alerting-System

IoT Based Flood Monitoring and Alerting System is a technology-driven solution aimed at providing real-time monitoring and early warning of floods in vulnerable areas. The system utilizes sensors and internet-connected devices to collect data on water levels and rainfall, which is then analyzed and used to trigger alerts in the event of a potential flood. The system can help authorities respond quickly to mitigate damage and prevent loss of life, as well as provide valuable information for future flood risk management and planning. This technology has the potential to revolutionize flood monitoring and alerting, ensuring timely and effective responses to this devastating natural hazard.
